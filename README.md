# CSA Final Project

  So this is just a small thing I made in java, it's not very big or well thought out because I made it for a class I have called CSA. so how you play is you type yes and no to progress through the "game". I say "game" because it's too small to be really considered an actual video game, at the moment there are four endings each one depending on your yes and no answers. If it presents you with other answers avalible then you can type those instead, anyway hopefully I can work on this a bit more after I'm done with the class, implimenting JOptionPane and some other stuff as well.
